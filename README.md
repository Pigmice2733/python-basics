Learn python through TDD (Test Driven Development)

## Setup

Install pytest via pip: `pip3 install -U pytest`

## Usage

Your job is to write functions to solve the tasks defined in `tests/mycode.py`. The functions have descriptions that tell you what to do, but it's also okay (even recommended) to look at the test and see what it's doing to see what behavior it expects. Write your solutions in `src/mycode.py`. When you think you've solved one thing, run `.\run_tests.bat`(Windows) or `./run_tests.sh` to see what works and what needs progress. When you finish all the tests, ask your lead for the secret key to see the solutions we implemented. These solutions are "idiomatic" meaning they are natural to a "native speaker" (like how in Spanish both "Me llamo" and "Mi nombre es" make sense, but "Me llamo" is idiomatic).
